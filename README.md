## Allelic imbalance task
To quantify the modelâ€™s performance in assessing chromatin accessibility allelic imbalance (CAAI) at single nucleotide variants (SNVs), we constructed a set of variants with allelic imbalance in each of proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule. To run this analysis, `kidney_finemapping/basenji/make_allelic_imbalance_sets.py`
